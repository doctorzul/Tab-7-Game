# Tâb Game: Web Implementation

This repository contains a web-based implementation of the **Tâb game**, created as part of the **Web Technologies** optional class in the **Computer Science Bachelor's degree** at **Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto (FCUP)**.

## Overview

The project is a basic browser game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates fundamental web development concepts while recreating the mechanics of the Tâb game for online play (where applicable) and offline play.

## Features

- Play the Tâb game in the browser
- Offline mode available
- Simple and clean interface
- Written entirely in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

## Installation / Usage

1. why would you wanna do that?
2. Just download everything and use it I guess
3. but why would you want to???


# Disclaimer
This project sucks! Like, actually sucks major ass! I hated this class with all my strength, which is INSANE because I actually quite like front-end development, and my groupmates were very kind and hard-working! The class is just absolute crap.  

Legit, trust me, once you open these files, you’re gonna be like: “wow, why would anyone make this!” Congratulations, you get it! You get the existential dread of optional classes, the weird feeling of coding something that feels simultaneously pointless and mildly educational.  

Don’t get me wrong, this project could’ve been a really fun challenge **HAD THIS NOT BEEN OUR VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THESE CODING LANGUAGES!!!** And sure, it’s not THAT bad, you may be thinking… except we had 2 weeks to mess around with HTML and CSS, and by week 3 they were already expecting us to start coding with JavaScript. Like, excuse me??? YOU HAVEN’T EVEN TAUGHT JAVASCRIPT YET!!! IT’S NOT GONNA BE ON THE LECTURES FOR AT LEAST TWO MORE WEEKS! HOW THE ACTUAL HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO “START CODING” WITH SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN BEFORE???  

So yeah, if this seems like it was half-done by ChatGPT, it’s because it was. Which is a shame, because I really would’ve loved to make something fun, great, and pretty in this class… but instead, it turned into this spaghetti-coded mess. Welcome to my pain. Enjoy.
